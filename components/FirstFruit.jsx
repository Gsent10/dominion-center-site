            Secret of Overwhelming blessing

        <p>
          The Bible is replete with virtually inexhaustible provisions for Man&apos;s comfort here on earth and in eternity. 
          The oldest singular limitation is Man&apos;s refusal to simply obey the WORD of GOD. 3 John 2 for instance reaffirmed 
          God&apos;s persistent intention and plan for man: Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in 
          health, even as thy soul prosperity. However, God not wanting to appear to man as a Dictator, grants man the 
          freewill to enjoy virtually endless benefits ONLY on the condition of total obedience, to the giver of these 
          benefits -The Almighty GOD.
